# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms are approached to solve problems by making the current best choice at each stage with the hope of getting the best answer overall as well. At each step of the algorithm, we choose the best possible option available without considering the consequences of the choice in future steps.

## Key Characteristics

- Make the best choice at each step (locally optimal)
- Do not reconsider previous choices
- Fast and simple to implement
- May not always yield the global optimum, but work well for many problems

### Limitations

- Not all problems can be solved using greedy algorithms. For some problems, dynamic programming or other approaches are required to guarantee an optimal solution.
